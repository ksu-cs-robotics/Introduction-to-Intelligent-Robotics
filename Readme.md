## üèÅ 1. Course Overview <a name = "overview"></a>
&emsp; Robots are being used in multiple places that are not easily accessible for humans, to support the lack of available labor, to gain extra precision, and for cost effective manufacturing processes, monitoring, space exploration, precision surgery and artificial limb support for elderly and physically challenged persons. Computer science is an integral part of robotics as it includes areas such as computer algorithms, artificial intelligence, and image processing that are essential aspects of robotics. The purpose of this course is to introduce you to the basic knowledge of robotic systems including modeling, design, planning, and control of robot systems. The material covered in this course consists of a brief description of the intrinsic geometry, kinematics, statics, mechanics and controls of robotic systems, as well as an introduction to examples and performance results using them. The course begins with an overview of such foundations before moving on to algorithmic elements of them in the context of intelligent robotic agents.
The course is delivered in a standard format of lectures, readings and problem sets, and aims to put the overall learning into practical application by conducting individual or group projects through several lab and practice hours.
The lectures are based primarily on, but not limited to, material from the Lecture Notes, textbook, and selected readings.



## üíæ 2. Environment Setup <a name = "pc_setup"></a>
### 2.1 PC Setup
#### 2.1.1 Personal PC Setup
During this class, we are going to use [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) as our main operating system. 

- If you already have **Ubuntu 16.04** insteaded, it is *preferable* to upgrade to 18.04 but *not necessary* to do so. 
- If you have a windows operating system, please follow [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ9ysibH768) to install **virtual box + ubuntu** on your system.(replace ubuntu *20.04* with *22.04*)
